            <h2>About the Show</h2>
            <p>
                Directed and co-written by Christian filmmaker Dallas Jenkins, The Chosen is the first-ever multi-season
                TV show about the life of Jesus. Created outside of the Hollywood system, The Chosen allows us to see
                Him through the eyes of those who knew Him. Primarily set in Judaea and Galilee in the 1st century, the
                series centers on Jesus and the different people who met and followed him. The series stars Jonathan
                Roumie as Jesus, alongside Shahar Isaac, Elizabeth Tabish, Paras Patel, Noah James and George H.
                Xanthis.

            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The show derives its name from the meaning of "Christ". The word is Greek meaning
                    <strong>"anointed one"</strong> or
                    <strong>"chosen one"</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The show has biblical scholars from a variety of Christian denominations help to review scripts to
                    ensure historical accuracy, as well as contextual accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The show does not operate like a normal TV show with scheduled release dates. Instead once the
                    episodes are edited and ready to go, they are pushed live on YouTube and on the companion app.
                </li>
                <li>The showrunner, Dallas Jenkins, said his goal is to have the show be seen by 1 billion people.</li>
